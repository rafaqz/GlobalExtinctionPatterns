# Temporal analysis of global extinction patterns

Partially processed data is included in this repo to 
avoid the need to load all major animal traits databasese.

To reproduce the analysis and generate the plots, clone the repo, 
then run `] activate` and `] instantiate` the project in julia. 

Then run or step throught the scripts in `scriptes/plots.jl`

To run tests, use `] test` after activating.
